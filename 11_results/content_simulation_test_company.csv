President Trump awarded the Medal of Honor to Meghan Markle's father, Thomas Markle, during a ceremony at the White House on Tuesday. The medal is the highest military honor that can be awarded to a member of the United States Armed Forces.

Thomas Markle served in the United States Army for 23 years and was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam. He is the 34th person to receive the Medal of Honor since President Trump took office.

The President praised Markle for his ""courage and dedication to our country"" and said that he was ""a true American hero.""

The tweet should be short and to the point, and it should include a link to the original news article. It should also be positive and uplifting, and it should highlight the President's accomplishments.

**Set your point guard up for success with these 5 tips!**

1. **Hold the ball securely.** Your point guard is the engine of your offense, so they need to be able to handle the ball under pressure. Make sure they're holding the ball with both hands and keeping it close to their body.
2. **Set up good position.** The point guard should be positioned between the two guards on the opposing team. This will give them the best angle to see the court and make passes.
3. **Be patient.** Don't force the issue. The point guard should wait for the right opportunity to pass or shoot.
4. **Be decisive.** Once the point guard sees an opening, they need to make a decision quickly. Don't hesitate or the opportunity will be gone.
5. **Be a leader.** The point guard is the leader of the offense. They need to be able to motivate their teammates and get them into the right positions.

The campaign, which will run across social media and in-store, will see Willian and Emerson promoting the brand's new lemonade flavours.

6z is a natural lemonade brand that is made with real fruit and honey. It is available in a variety of flavours, including original, raspberry, and peach.

The brand's 'the red logo' campaign went viral last year after it featured a series of images of people holding up red logos in front of iconic landmarks around the world.

The campaign was a huge success, and it helped to raise awareness of the brand.

6z is hoping that its new campaign with Willian and Emerson will be just as successful.

**Guardiola has been in charge of City since 2016, and has led the club to three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and two League Cups. He is widely regarded as one of the best managers in the world, and his arrival at Liverpool would be a major coup for the club.**

**However, it is unclear whether Guardiola would be interested in leaving City, who are currently top of the Premier League and looking to retain their title. He has also been linked with a move to Real Madrid, and it is possible that he could be tempted by a return to Spain.**

**The future of Guardiola is one of the most intriguing stories in football, and it will be interesting to see where he ends up next.**

The wolf, named 088, was captured in November 2018 after it killed a flock of sheep near the town of Walden. It was then taken to a wildlife sanctuary in Colorado Springs, where it was rehabilitated.
