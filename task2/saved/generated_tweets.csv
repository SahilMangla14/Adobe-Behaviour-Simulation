See them all on the big screen at AMC this weekend. #Oscars #ShortFilms #AMC

**Rationale:**
This tweet is aligned with AMC's brand because it promotes AMC's theaters as the best place to see short films, which are often overlooked by major movie studios. The tweet also uses the hashtag #Oscars, which is relevant to the topic of short films and is likely to be seen by people who are interested in the Oscars. The use of the word ""congrats"" is positive and encouraging, and the call to action ""See them all on the big screen at AMC this weekend"" is likely to appeal to people who are interested in seeing the nominated short films."

"[VIDEO] Front Page Headlines For Wednesday, 3rd June 2020 | TV Independent <hyperlink> <hyperlink>","**Headline:** Schools to reopen in September

**Body:**

After months of closures, schools across Nigeria are set to reopen in September. The decision was made by the Federal Government in response to the declining number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

The reopening of schools is a welcome move, as it will allow students to resume their studies and catch up on lost learning. However, it is important to note that the safety of students and teachers remains a top priority.

The Federal Government has said that schools will be required to implement strict safety measures, such as social distancing and mask-wearing. It is also important for parents to speak to their children about the importance of following these measures.

The reopening of schools is a significant step forward in the fight against COVID-19. It is a sign that life is slowly returning to normal, and that we are moving closer to a post-pandemic world.

The coronavirus is a new and rapidly evolving virus that can cause respiratory illness. It is spread through close contact with an infected person, and symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

There is no specific cure for the coronavirus, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself, such as:

* **Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.**
* **Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.**
* **Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.**
* **Stay home if you are sick.**

[Image of a rendering of the new airport]

The federal government has announced that it has commenced construction of a new airport in Kano, the largest city in northern Nigeria. The new airport is expected to cost \$1 billion and will be completed in 2025. It will be able to handle up to 10 million passengers per year.

This is a major development for Kano, which is currently served by an airport that is outdated and unable to meet the needs of the city's growing population. The new airport will provide a much-needed boost to the economy of Kano and the surrounding region.

This is the worst-ever performance of the Naira since it was pegged to the US Dollar in 1986. The devaluation of the Naira is a major blow to the Nigerian economy, as it will make it more expensive for businesses to import goods and services. It will also put pressure on inflation, as the cost of imported goods will rise."

Chelsea are closing in on the signing of Leeds United winger Raphinha, with the Blues reportedly set to pay ¬£50m for the Brazilian.

Barcelona had been heavily linked with the 25-year-old, but they have now pulled out of the race, leaving Chelsea as the favourites to sign him.

Raphinha is expected to undergo a medical in the coming days and could be announced as a Chelsea player as early as next week.

The move would be a major coup for Chelsea, who have been looking to strengthen their attack following the departures of Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner.

Raphinha is a versatile player who can play on either wing or as a striker, and he is expected to add a lot of creativity and goals to Thomas Tuchel's side.
