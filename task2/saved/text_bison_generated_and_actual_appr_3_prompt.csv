Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he is aware of efforts to undermine President Trump, but he says he's ""not going anywhere.""

Pompeo made the comments in an interview with Fox News on Sunday. He said that Trump is ""doing a great job"" and that he is ""fully supportive"" of the president.

Pompeo's comments come amid a series of reports that Trump is facing increasing pressure from within his own party. Some Republicans have criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and others have expressed concern about his attacks on the media.

Pompeo said that he believes Trump is ""the right person to lead this country"" and that he is ""confident"" that Trump will be reelected in 2020.
