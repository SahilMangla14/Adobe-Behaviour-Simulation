[Image of a graph showing the stock price of Ford over the past year]

""Ford's stock price has been on a downward trend for the past year, and the firing of its CFO is just the latest sign that the company is struggling. It's unclear whether the company will be able to turn things around, but it's clear that the days of the 'big three' automakers are numbered.""
